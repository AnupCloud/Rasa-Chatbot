  utter_corona_intro:
  - text: Coronaviruses are a group of related viruses that cause diseases in mammals
      and birds. In humans, coronaviruses cause respiratory tract infections that
      can be mild, such as some cases of the common cold (among other possible causes,predominantly
      rhinoviruses), and others that can be lethal, such as SARS, MERS, and COVID-19
  utter_corona_spread:
  - text: This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
  utter_corona_food_spread:
  - text: Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through
      respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission
      of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important
      to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food
      safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing
      or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.
  utter_warm_weather:
  - text: It is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of
      COVID-19. Some other viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more during
      cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with
      these viruses during other months.  At this time, it is not known whether the
      spread of COVID-19 will decrease when weather becomes warmer.  There is much
      more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated
      with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.
  utter_high_risk:
  - text: Older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions
      may be at higher risk for more serious complications from COVID-19. These people
      who may be at higher risk of getting very sick from this illness, includes;
      Older adults, People who have serious underlying medical conditions like...
      Heart disease, Diabetes, Lung disease
  utter_ocr_stored:
  - text: It is saved in [Saved Text] variable which is accessible from Text Input

  utter_text_input:
  - text: Being at the foremost layer of the screen does not necessarily mean Windows
      focus is on it. You must reactivate the App by inserting Select Window operation
      or Click and Focus operation immediately before.
  utter_plugin_work:
  - text: Upto STU ver. R19.0917, it has three (3) variable schemes. They are 1)predefined
      global variables, 2)user defined variables, and 3)plugin defined variables.
      In the plugin, only when you desire a CSV to stored as a variable, you must
      use the plugin defined variable. In this case, the values are stored in multi
      dimesional CSV format and you can acces data by a notation as {{group name.header
      name(row number)}}. In this case, the header name comes from the first row of
      the data (row = 0). If the first row contains data check box has been checked
      the header name are automatically assigned to A,B,C,D, as in Excel sheet (in
      uppercase alphabets). The row number must be an integer.
  utter_crash_faq:
  - text: "If you have tested the bot before the crash, the last tested bot is stored\
      \ in this folder.\n(C/ users/ yourusername/ appData/ roaming/ argosScenarioStudio/\
      \ scenarioFiles/ testRun).\nWe are very sorry that STU crashed on you. Please\
      \ send the log to our tech support team and we will try our best to prevent\

  utter_change_path:
  - text: "The default save path has been changed from ‘Application data’ to ‘Documents’\
      \ since R19.0917.\nIt won't change with the update, but it will change easily\
      \ when loading the bot from another folder.\nDefault Bot storage -  %homepath%\\\

      \ (or saved) a Bot at the previous running of STU.\nSTU always remembers the\
      \ last folder information. ( stored in Windows Registry )\n\n\nHow to change\
      \ the default save path Default location - %homepath%\\documents\\ArgosScenarioStudio\\\
      ScenarioFiles Change ‘Scenario File path’ in ‘Settings > Options’ Move the existing\
